*An AI that plays chess and is hopefully better than me*

This project is written in Java 17 using the Maven project management tool. Currently, the chess program itself is complete, though testing still needs to be done and then I'll start work on the AI.

## Build process

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ben9583/chess-ai.git chess-ai && cd chess-ai
mvn build
```
